### [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this challenge I was tasked with refactoring an existing google book search api that was built using RESTful API, and change it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. I used mutations to fetch and modify data, modified the existing authentication middlewear, and created an Apollo Provider to communicate with the Apollo Server. 



### [Installation](#table-of-contents)
To install this application please either clone the repo or download the zip file. Once open in the code editor of your choice, open the terminal and install all packages used. You can do this by typing "npm i" in your command line, when in the root directory. Once installed type "npm run develop" in the command line to start this application. 



### [Usage](#table-of-contents)
This app should function the same as the starter code. You should be able to search for books in the search bar when not logged in. When presented with the login screen, you are asked to either log in, or create a login profile. Once logged in you will then be able to save books to your favorites, or remove books you no longer wish to save. 



### [Contributing](#table-of-contents)
I am currently not accepting contributions to this project.



### [Tests](#table-of-contents)
You can test this application by running the program in GraphQL. You can do this by running it locally and at this link "http://localhost:3001/graphql". From here you should be able to test all mutations and queries.
